# Manipulate-AR-objects-using-UI-Gesture-and-Hand-Gesture
This repository shows how to manipulate AR objects using UI Gesture and Hand Gesture. UI Geture includes UITapGestureRecognizer for pan gesture and rotation gesture. As for hand gesture, the Vision framework is used which detects the location of the index tip and moves the objects to the finger location.
